Manarat International University (MIU) is one of the few private universities of Bangladesh, which had built its own premises at the time of receiving the Charter from the Government. Manarat Trust is the founder of MIU. A cherished dream to establish a university had been in the bosom of every Manarat Trust member. MIU was born with a vision to inculcate ethical and moral dimension while offering a comprehensive professional training. Through overwhelming support and inspired dedication, the university project was underway. Ahmed Farid, the former Vice-chancellor, was offered the monumental task to lead the MIU Project Team as the Project Director. He assumed his role in 1996 and since then, even during the periods of ebbing hope and frustration, he stuck to his vision and inspired the project team to endeavor for the much desired Charter of Approval. Ministry of Education of the Government of Bangladesh granted Manarat the permission to establish a university under Private University Act, 1992, as amended in 1998. On the 3rd April 2001 the birth of MIU was confirmed with the Charter awarded to it by the Ministry of Education on the recommendation of the University Grants Commission. MIU was inaugurated on the 21st of May 2001 amidst a modest ceremony arranged for the first batch of incoming students and their guardians. Manarat is now poised to contribute to the human resource development by expanding the scope of higher education in Bangladesh. MIU’s International Advisory Board consisting of distinguished academicians, scholars, researchers and entrepreneurs from noteworthy international universities and organizations provides advice and counsel on academic programs and standards. MIU has signed official collaboration agreement with California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) and is in progress to develop similar arrangements with other globally reputed universities. The spirit of MIU is to foster a congenial atmosphere for intellectual growth, moral uplift and professional excellence. MIU epitomizes quintessential amalgamation of scholastic development, enriched co-curricular environment and commitment to principles and values. The courses and all aspects of the academic program are modeled on North American universities reflecting a rich blend of sub-continental issues. MIU’s first freshmen classes began on May 28, 2001 with 73 students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Computer Science and Information Technology, and in the Department of Business Administration of the School of Business and Economics. MIU Board of Trustees Manarat Trust has been in the service of the society in Bangladesh since 1981. For nearly two decades it has attained credibility and goodwill in the civil society by dint of its contribution to the different avenues of social service. Manarat Trust was formed by some Islam loving intellectuals and social thinkers of national and international reputation with a sacred mission of working towards Islamization of knowledge and creating a value based educational center of excellence in Bangladesh. The first noble venture of the Trust began with the establishment of an English medium Kinder Garten School named Manarat Dhaka in 1979. In 1985 the School was renamed as Manarat International School. With gradual advancement of the students to higher classes and with the launching of an English medium HSC level program, the name of the school was changed to Manarat International College in 1991. At this stage the Trust felt that the cherished goal for the Islamization of knowledge should not be confined to school and college levels only. Promotional efforts for the formation of a University, therefore, started in 1995 and the project document for setting up Manarat International University (MIU) was submitted in 1996. After protracted negotiations and communications with the concerned authority over a period of five years, MIU finally got its formal approval in 2001. According to the Private University Act-2010 “Manarat Trust” for university is now reconstituted as “MIU Board of Trustees”. As a founder MIU Board of Trustees is fully committed to providing unstinted support and upholds the spirit and purpose of MIU. It is imperative to mention the names of those illustrious individuals who rendered relentless support and encouragement in their best possible capacities. Without them, this manifest destiny of the noble institution could not have been achieved. Therefore, MIU extends its profound gratitude and warmest regards to the Board of Trust members who have been instrumental as well as cardinal to realize a dream that has been cherished by the entire Muslim Ummah.

The firm belief that those techniques can be most effective only when used in the spirit of collaboration and teamwork A dedication to providing students with superior education customized to their interests, and needs of the society. Committed full time faculty with excellent educational backgrounds and sharpest academic minds. Scopes and Strategies At the end of the last millennium, it was evident that the new century would be the century of knowledge. Whoever holds the knowledge will be fit to survive in this millennium. With the advent of increased globalization, a fundamental shift has occurred in how and where business is pursued. Dynamic forms of business are evolving where geographical boundaries are quickly vanishing. Businesses are shifting operations to geographical locations where human resources of high skill sets are available at competitive prices. To stay competitive and face the challenges of the brave new world, it is imperative to develop human capital that is globally competent. MIU has designed all of its programs that accomplish these tasks. By transcending the frontiers of knowledge, we have incorporated the global perspective in our teaching and have ensured improvisation and cross fertilization of ideas that continuously breathe new life in our academic arena. Furthermore, MIU contends that the modus operand of this paradigm is to maintain close cooperation with prestigious institutions of the world. Keeping the global view in focus, MIU emphasizes on incorporating realities of global business environment. The global perspective is seen in our continuous search for international collaboration, globally oriented teaching material, and recruitment of superb faculty with international backgrounds. </p></div><div class="col-span-2 p-4"><div class="sticky top-16"><h2 class="w-full text-2xl font-semibold">Notice</h2><div class="w-full mt-5"><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> Jun 11 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF:Notice for extension of registration </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 24 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF:Make up Notice_Evening </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div><div class="w-full border-b mt-3 py-1"><div class="text-gray-400 text-sm w-full"> May 23 </div><div> Full Notice in PDF: Make up Exam Notice </div></div></div></div></div>',2)];const s={},r=(0,i(744).Z)(s,[["render",function(e,t){return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("div",o,n)}]])}}]);
